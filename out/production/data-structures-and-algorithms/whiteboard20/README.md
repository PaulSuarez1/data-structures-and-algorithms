### Problem domain:
#### Flip a tree so every node appears on the opposite branch.
## Solution
#### Read up on recuision some more and used it to traverse down each .right and .left and assign that node to the oposite branche's node.
### This solution works great and that's verified by the printout but I'm getting a random null pointer exception so dont know what that's happening.
